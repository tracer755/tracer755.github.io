  <h2>Troop 456 Information</h2>
  <br>
  <h5>Troop 456 is about 20 Boy Scouts strong, ranging in rank from Scout to Eagle, with active adult leadership. Our Charter Organization is the Elks Lodge #1650. We are a boy-run troop with adult guidance and family participation. The Scoutmaster and all assistant scoutmasters are BSA trained. Troop 456 is proud to have had active outings and activities for many years, and has graduated over 90 eagle scouts over the years.</h5>
  <br>
  <ul>
    <li class="orange">
      <h5><strong>Troop Meetings</strong>: We meet Mondays at 7:00 PM basement of the Elks Lodge #1650 in downtown Littleton except on holidays when the Elks Lodge is closed. (map on <a class="orangelink" href="index.html">home page</a>) Zoom meetings are held when the Elks Lodge is not available for meetings.</h5>
    </li>
    <li class="orange">
      <h5><strong>Activities</strong>: "3/4 of Scouting is Outing," So:</h5>
      <ul>
        <li class="orange">
          <h6>We typically have one camping trip per month (usually the 2nd or 3rd weekend of every month), as well as additional single-day events (hikes, service projects). We also occasionally have non-summer-camp outings that can be a week long, such as backpacking trips.</h6>
        </li>
        <li class="orange">
          <h6>We attend a week-long Scout Camp each summer, usually alternating yearly between a camp at Peaceful Valley Scout Camp, and camps outside the local area (including out-of-state).</h6>
        </li>
        <li class="orange">
          <h6>Older scouts also can participate in an annual, week-long "High Adventure" trip. Recent trips include British Virgin Islands sailing, Boundary Waters canoeing, Philmont, Green River rafting, and backpacking the Arapahoe Peaks wilderness.</h6>
        </li>
        <li class="orange">
          <h6>We also participate in the many District and Council outdoor offerings, including Scout Show, Camporees, Klondorees, Okpik, and Bighorn National Youth Leadership Training.</h6>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li class="orange">
      <h5><strong>Troop Governance</strong>: The troop is chartered by the Elks Lodge #1650 and governed by the Troop Committee. Troop activities are planned by the boys via the <u>Patrol Leaders Council</u>, which are then approved by the Troop Committee. The role of the Committee is to facilitate the program designed by the boys, offer guidance as needed, and to oversee the finances and safety of the troop. The Troop Committee meets monthly, and parents are encouraged to attend.</h5>
    </li>
    <li class="orange">
      <h5><strong>Dues and Fundraising</strong>: Dues are $150 per year. Numerous fundraising opportunities are available, including popcorn sales, camp cards, and King Soopers gift cards. Unless otherwise dictated by the Denver Area Council or the Troop Committee, all net proceeds from fundraising go directly to the boysâ€™ unit accounts. There are typically plenty of opportunities for the boys to earn their dues as well as funds to cover other scouting expenses, including summer camp.</h5>
    </li>
    <li class="orange">
      <h5><strong>Adult Participation</strong>: Parents are expected to assist the troop in some capacity. There is always a need for logistical support, such as helping with transportation, attending campouts, or assisting with fundraising activities. The Troop Committee will solicit assistance as needed and will appreciate your help.</h5>
